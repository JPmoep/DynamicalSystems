    "# Solution hints for exercise sheet 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "Besides checking the conditions for a dynamical system, please make sure that you get an intuition as to why these conditions are meaningful in the first place. And so, the conditions are that $\\varphi_0 = \\text{id}$ and $\\varphi_t\\circ\\varphi_s = \\varphi_{t+s}$ for any $t,s\\in\\mathcal{T}$. Usually, each $\\varphi_t$ is required to have some additional regularity like measurability, continuity or smoothness, consistent with the regularity structure of the space that the $\\varphi$'s act on.\n",
    "1. It is straightforward to check that $\\varphi_0 \\neq \\text{id}$. Therefore, this cannot be a dynamical system.\n",
    "2. There are two options here:\n",
    "   * You check the algebraic conditions by hand, making use of [angle sum identities/Additionstheoreme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_trigonometric_identities#Angle_sum_and_difference_identities), to verify that this is indeed a dynamical system.\n",
    "   * You realize that the given dynamical system candidate is the backward solution of the well-posed harmonic oscillator equation, i.e., $\\varphi_t=\\varphi_{-t}^{\\text{osc}}$, from which it directly follows that this is a dynamical system (recall, that general solutions to well-posed ODEs form dynamical systems).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2\n",
    "You can solve the differential equation for any initial condition up to the zeros of the rhs using the separation of variables approach [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+x%27+%3D+x*log(x)). This approach gives a valid solution formula until a solution possibly hits the equilibrium. The zeros of the rhs, however, correspond exactly to equilibria of the dynamical system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rhs function vanishes obviously at $x=1$. Moreover, it can be continuously extended to $x=0$ by the function value $0$ (check with L'Hopital). Therefore, the two equilibria are 0 and 1. We need to clarify, however, on which domain the ODE is guaranteed to be well-posed. For any equilibrium that falls into that domain we are guaranteed that no solution can attain it, since this would violate uniqueness of solutions. Make sure you follow this argument: as I exaggerated in the tutorial session, violation-of-uniqueness-of-solutions is one word, and you should be able to use this argument. To this end, we need local Lipschitz-continuity, which holds for $x>0$, but fails for $x=0$. This means, that we may have distinct solutions growing out of $x_0=0$. For that reason, it is safer to exclude 0 from the domain of the dynamical system, unless we had alternative arguments for the uniqueness of the equilibrium solution $x=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 3\n",
    "1. Prove by contradiction, assuming that $S$ is positively invariant and $\\mathcal{X}\\setminus S$ is not negatively invariant.\n",
    "2. This is clear since $(-1,1)^{\\top}$ is an eigenvector of the system's matrix:"

    "3. (This should be a 3., but markdown does its own counting; sorry for the inconvenience :-)) This is probably best shown by tracking the value of $E$ along solutions of the pendulum equation, which satisfy\n",
